It's a tic-tac-toe game, basically i buid this game while learning the javascript and i really enjoy it . sometimes some hurdles come but i tackle them and successfully build this game
The main thing in the behind is Javascript, the gaame is build using the javascript.
i used css for styling.
the HTML is used for forming the structure of the game & the css and js are include in this.
